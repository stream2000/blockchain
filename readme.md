# Blockchain demo

A blockchain demo. 

I use multi-thread to simulate the real-world distributed system. For simplification, we have only empty transaction in our system. 

If I have spare time in the future, I will try to refactor this project. Maybe I will turn it into a real distributed system, or turn it into a state-machined based multi-thread project.
